# cli-wrapper

## Installation
First, you will need NPM. If you already have it, that should be fine. If not, I suggest [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#about)

Once you have NPM working, in the project's directory run
* `npm install` - to install dependencies
* `npm run build` - to transpile the code (This may print an error in Windows, but ignore it, linux just needs an extra step with `chmod`)
* `npm link` - to make the newly built executable available anywhere
* `wrap resize -h` - to print the help for the command
